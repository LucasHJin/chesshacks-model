Strategy:
- Get dataset
- Build vocab (64x64 + promotions)
- Stream process PGN (with filter)
- Store as (board tensor - 3d tensor, move index)
    - (17, 8, 8) -> shows entire board for each of the pieces (6 per side) + castleing / en passant
- Augment data? (horizontal flip)
- Save each as big pytorch tensors
- Architecture -> CNN (layers takes 3D, flattened at the end, output 4672 possible moves)
- Train with PyTorch (dataloaders, dataset, adam optimizer, cross entropy loss)
- Integrate with modal
- Inference engine
    - Get legal moves, choose highest probability,
